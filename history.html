    . It truly reflects the rich and cultural heritage and warm hospitality of the people of India. With a civilization of more than five thousand years old, India is a country with an amazing wealth of diversity. India stretches from the eternal snows of the Himalayas in the north to the peninsulas of the south from the arid desert of the west to the humid deltas of the east from the dry heat and cold of the central plateau to the cool forest foothills and the golden beaches. Thus, it offers an incredible choice of destinations for a visiting tourist to relish and enjoy.

    India is a land apart, a destination like no other; mysterious-, colorful, exotic, and always memorable. A visit to the country is a changing spectacle of religions, customs, festivals, sights and sounds. With a historical backdrop of 5,000 years, India is one big package of culture and legend that never fails to captivate the imagination of the visitor. From the moment that one sets foot in India to be greeted by a graceful Namaste, a gesture that denotes both welcome and respect, one is on his Way to the most rewarding experience of his life.

It connects the Charminar with the Golconda Fort, situated in the western part of Hyderabad.
    Charminar, the name itself spells a charm. But what was it actually? There are many theories behind it, which are basically information from various sources collated together and exaggerated, while some are backed by certain evidence. However, after all this time, some of the theories suffered a natural death, while some still prevail in one form or another.
    
    Yet, for visitors who visit this place, they can’t stop gawking and remain spellbound for a good amount of time. It is proudly pronounced as the landmark of Hyderabad city. In fact, a trip to this city of Nizams cannot be considered to be complete if you don’t fix a date with Charminar.

    The reason why Jal Mahal can be counted amongst the top 10 mysterious places in India is the story of how it came to be. It was built 300 years ago by the Raja as a hunting lodge. However, when the King of Amer decided to build a dam between the two surrounding hills to save the city from floods in the 18th century, the depression around the palace started filling up with water. Today, when you look across the Man Sagar Lake, you see this palace in the middle, with one floor and plant life peeking from above its roof. Another aspect that makes it such a prominent pick among mystery places in India is the fact that the water hides 4 more floors below it. Little else is known about this structure which has no chambers but a pavilion and a terrace garden.</p>

A popular shooting location for movies, Ramoji Film City has seen everything from actors who confess of seeing some "strange figures" in the mirror while getting ready for a shoot, huge chandeliers falling from roofs during film shoots to lightmen complaining of some invisible force that tries to push them down from the parapets. Security guards at the Ramoji Film City become a tad more cautious once the sun sets, for the place is believed to be haunted by spirits of soldiers who died here in the many wars during the reign of Nizams

Watch the day bidding adieu and a beautiful evening taking over. As the golden sun dips behind temples, the lake’s water mirrors the changing hues of the sky from blue to orange and then red and slowly black takes over transforming the day into a beautiful night.

    Spend some quiet hours sitting on the stairs of the lake listening to the music coming from all directions - hymns and bells from the temple, nagara beats from the ghat, gentle strumming of a guitar from some cafe and the sound of Ravanhatha being played by some bhopa musician sitting just next to you. While you are lost in the music, the lake turns gorgeous with the reflection of town lights and numerous stars. I love watching the day end by the lake side and being just with me; slowly pilgrims leave temples, tourists go back to the market or the hotels, sanyasis go hiding into their kutiya and you are left alone on the stairs gazing at the glittering sky and the lake. The calm cool air from the lake fills you with tranquillity.

 <h1 style="font-size: 2.5rem; font-family: 'Kaushan Script' ;  margin-left: 6rem; font-weight: bolder;"> Why Monuments are built ?</h1> 

 <p style="width: 50%;">
 <p style="width: 80%; shape-outside: circle(); font-size: 1rem; margin-left: 6rem; font-family: 'Arial' ; font-style: normal; font-weight: lighter;">A monument is a type of structure that was explicitly created to commemorate a person or event, or which has become relevant to a social group as a part of their remembrance of historic times or cultural heritage, due to its artistic, historical, political, technical or architectural importance. Some of the first monuments were dolmens or menhirs, megalithic constructions built for religious or funerary purposes.Examples of monuments include statues, (war) memorials, historical buildings, archaeological sites, and cultural assets. If there is a public interest in its preservation, a monument can for example be listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>

   
   <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; font-family: 'Kaushan Script';margin-left: 6rem; font-weight: bolder;">Etymology</h2> 
<p style="width: 80%; font-size: 1rem; margin-left: 6rem; font-family: 'Arial' ; font-style: normal; font-weight: lighter;"> The origin of the word "monument" comes from the Greek mnemosynon and the Latin moneo, monere, which means 'to remind', 'to advise' or 'to warn', suggesting a monument allows us to see the past thus helping us visualize what is to come in the future. In English the word "monumental" is often used in reference to something of extraordinary size and power, as in monumental sculpture, but also to mean simply anything made to commemorate the dead, as a funerary monument or other example of funerary art.</p>


 <h2 style="font-size: 2rem; font-family: 'Kaushan Script';margin-left: 6rem; font-weight: bolder;"> Loss and destruction</h2> 
<p style="width: 80%; font-size: 1rem; margin-left: 6rem; font-family: 'Arial'  ; shape-outside: content-box; font-style: normal; font-weight: lighter;"> While many ancient monuments still exist today, there are notable incidents of monuments being intentionally or accidentally destroyed and many monuments are likely to have disappeared through the passage of time and natural forces such as erosion. In 772 during the Saxon Wars, Charlemagne intentionally destroyed an Irminsul monument in order to desecrate the pagan religion. In 1687 the Parthenon in Athens was partially destroyed and looted by a Venetian soldier who shot a reserve of gunpowder stored there.[8] A recent archeological dig in central France uncovered the remains of a Megalithic monument that had been previously destroyed "Like some monuments, including Belz in Morbihan, the menhirs of Veyre-Monton were knocked down in order to make them disappear from the landscape. Pushed into large pits, sometimes mutilated or covered with earth, these monoliths have been destroyed. 'object of iconoclastic gestures, a sort of condemnation perhaps linked to some change of community or beliefs. "</p>



<p style=" margin-right: 3rem; font-size: 1rem; margin-left: 6rem; font-family: 'Arial' ;shape-outside: circle(); margin-top: 2rem; font-style: normal; font-weight: lighter;"> The term is often used to describe any structure that is a significant and legally protected historic work, and many countries have equivalents of what is called in United Kingdom legislation a Scheduled Monument, which often include relatively recent buildings constructed for residential or industrial purposes, with no thought at the time that they would come to be regarded as "monuments".

Until recently, it was customary for archaeologists to study large monuments and pay less attention to the everyday lives of the societies that created them. New ideas about what constitutes the archaeological record have revealed that certain legislative and theoretical approaches to the subject are too focused on earlier definitions of monuments. An example has been the United Kingdom's Scheduled Ancient Monument laws.


Other than municipal or national government that protecting the monuments in their jurisdiction, there are institutions dedicated on the efforts to protect and preserve monuments that considered to possess special natural or cultural significance for the world, such as UNESCO's World Heritage Site programme and World Monuments Fund.

Cultural monuments are also considered to be the memory of a community and are therefore particularly at risk in the context of modern asymmetrical warfare. The enemy's cultural heritage is to be sustainably damaged or even destroyed. In addition to the national protection of cultural monuments, international organizations (cf. UNESCO World Heritage, Blue Shield International) therefore try to protect cultural monuments.

Recently, more and more monuments are being preserved digitally (in 3D models) through organisations as CyArk .</p>

<p style="width: 85%; font-size: 1rem; margin-left: 6rem; font-family: 'Arial' ;shape-outside: circle(); margin-top: 2rem; font-style: normal; font-weight: lighter;" >I would like to canvas views on whether or not editors feel it appropriate to have links to the ARCHI database of more than 110,000 UK sites on monuments on the Archaeology UK website ARCHI Database. One of the patrollers insists that this counts as link spam and has removed the link. However, the database allows users to locate UK Archaelogical Sites and Monuments within the UK.

 <h1 style="margin-left: 6rem; color: black; font-family: 'Kaushan Script'; margin-top: 3rem;"> Most Visited Cities :</h1>
 <p  style="margin-left: 6rem; width: 70%; font-weight: lighter; font-family: 'Arial'; color: black; margin-top: 3rem;">Urban self-government was practically lacking in ancient India. With the pace of industrialization the number of cities began to grow. In India, too, like other parts of the world the cities have increased mainly by immigration from villages.</p>

<p style="width: 80%; shape-outside: circle(); font-size: 1rem; margin-left: 6rem; font-family: 'Arial' ; font-style: normal; font-weight: lighter; line-height: 2rem;">Travelling means going from one place to another in different purposes. They also explore to see the unseen and know the unknown. The travellers always travel the most beautiful places of the world which uphold the existence of nature. All things are created by Allah. There are many means to see the unseen and know the unknown, but travelling is the best of all. For example: Reading books gives us literal knowledge, listening story gives us indefinite ideas, but travelling gives us visual as well as concrete knowledge. At the same time, people do not travel in the same purposes. Someone travels to gain knowledge and experience, someone travels for pleasure, someone travels for business purposes etc. There are different types of travelling like- travelling by air, bus, boat, train, bus etc. Every travelling has much educative value. It is a part of education. Our education and book knowledge remain imperfect without travelling. For this reason, we can learn many things by travelling. It teaches us trade and commerce, language, sociology, customs, culture, history, geography and so on. Therefore, the educative value of travelling beggars description. Besides, there are some special benefits of travelling. If a man stays at one place for a long time, he becomes monotonous and his life becomes boring and callous. Travelling removes our monotony and gives pleasure. Similarly, it also broadens our outlook and refreshes our mind. A good traveler can easily educate others. He can give us first-hand knowledge of men and matters of other country. I like travelling very much.</p>

<p style="width: 80%; shape-outside: circle(); font-size: 1rem; margin-left: 6rem; font-family: 'Arial' ; font-style: normal; font-weight: lighter; line-height: 2rem;"> There are a lot of reasons to travel. Some people travel for fun while some do it for education purposes. Similarly, others have business reasons to travel. In order to travel, one must first get an idea of their financial situation and then proceed.

Understanding your own reality helps people make good travel decisions. If people gave enough opportunities to travel, they set out on the journey. People going on educational tours get a first-hand experience of everything they’ve read in the text.

Similarly, people who travel for fun get to experience and indulge in refreshing things which may serve as a stress reducer in their lives. The culture, architecture, cuisine and more of the place can open our mind to new things.</p>
